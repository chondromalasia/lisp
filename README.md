# Common Lisp

Long and short of it, this is my backup and solutions to [Stuart Shapiro's 'Common Lisp an Interactive Approach'](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Commonlisp/).
Really everything on that front can be found in `practice/` and as of this writing, I am finish up Chapter 18, which is brutal fwiw.
