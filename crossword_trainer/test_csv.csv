2010,Mon,"""___ Baba and the 40 Thieves""",ALI,96,"""Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves"" is a film released in 1944 directed by Arthur Lubin. It is very loosely based on the tale of Ali Baba from the book ""One Thousand and One Nights"", a collection of Arabic stories compiled in what is termed the Islamic Golden Age (the 8th to 13th centuries AD). In English we often refer to the collection as ""The Arabian Nights""."
2010,Mon,Rope-a-dope boxer,ALI,96,"The Rumble in the Jungle was that celebrated fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, broadcast from Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). The fight was set in Zaire because of financial arrangements between promoter Don King and Zaire's President Mobuto Seko. Rope-a-dope was the term coined by Ali to describe his incredibly successful strategy in the contest. From the second round onwards, Ali adopted a protected stance on the ropes, letting Foreman pound him with blows to the body and head, using his arms to take most of the punches. He kept this up until the eighth round, then opened up, and downed the exhausted Foreman with a left-right combination. I hate boxing, but have to say, that was an interesting fight."

2010,Sun,"""Prince ___"" (""Aladdin"" song)",ALI,96,"The Disney animated feature ""Aladdin"" was released in 1992, and is one of the best features to come out of the studio, I think, largely due to the great performance by Robin Williams who voiced the Genie.

2010,Sun,"Ryan's ""Love Story"" co-star",ALI,96,"""Love Story"" was released in 1970, and has to be one of the most romantic films of all time. The film stars Ryan O'Neill and Ali McGraw, with the screenplay written by Erich Segal.
